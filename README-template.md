# Frontend Mentor - Intro section with dropdown navigation solution

This is a solution to the [Intro section with dropdown navigation challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation-ryaPetHE5).

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
-   View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 mark-up
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I want to improve the UX for the sub-menus in the navigation as they are poor to use at the moment.
